# How to run
* Navigate to the folder/app directory
* Run npm install to install dependencies
* Execute npm run dev and visit http://localhost:5173/

# Utilizing Core Chain
* Use $CORE as stake for each battle, winner takes $CORE from loser
* Utilizing Core Chain transaction speed with high throughput ensuring seamless and efficient interactions such as: creating matches and challenging others instantly, greatly enhancing the gaming experience.

# Technical Workflow
* User chooses 3 NFTs then stakes $CORE to contract to create struct with unique battleID in contract
* Backend verifies on-chain data and creates a queue with that battleID and the NFT squad user chose
* Other user who joins that battleID must deposit the same amount of money to contract and choose 3 NFTs to battle
* After verifying on-chain, backend processes battle and returns the signature to address who won to withdraw the stake (the contract nonce prevents signature reuse and has rule that only defender or attacker can withdraw money)
